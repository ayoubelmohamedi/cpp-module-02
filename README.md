## Description
This project covers key concepts in C++, including the Orthodox Canonical Form, fixed-point numbers, and operator overloading.

## Concepts Covered
### 1. Orthodox Canonical Form
  * The Orthodox Canonical Form (OCF) refers to a set of rules for writing classes in C++ to ensure proper resource management and consistency.
  * It includes the implementation of the following:
      * Default Constructor
      * Copy Constructor
      * Copy Assignment Operator
      *  Destructor
    * This form ensures that objects are correctly copied and destroyed, preventing resource leaks and undefined behavior.
### 2. Fixed-Point Numbers
  * Fixed-point numbers are a way to represent fractional numbers using integers.
  * This is useful in scenarios where floating-point arithmetic is either not available or not desired
  * The project demonstrates the implementation and usage of fixed-point arithmetic in C++.

### 3. Operator Overloading
  * Operator overloading allows customizing the behavior of operators for user-defined types.
  * This makes it possible to use operators like +, -, *, /, etc., with objects of custom classes in an intuitive way.
  * The project showcases how to overload operators to work with fixed-point numbers and other classes.
